					Historic Virginia Highland is Atlanta's most popular neighborhood for shopping, dining and nightlife. Developed in the early 1900's, it consists of seven distinct commercial "villages" alternating with short, walkable blocks of charming bungalow homes. The neighborhood's name derives from the intersection of Virginia and Highland Avenues.

		<h2>History</h2>

		<p>
				After the Atlanta Street Railway Company opened up the Virginia-Highland area to suburban development in 1890, developers began buying farms in the area and subdividing them for residential and limited commercial uses. Houses and streets were developed to relate directly to the trolley line and minimize the walk between homes and transit. Small commercial blocks were also developed within a few feet of the trolley stops to capitalize on both trolley riders and neighbors alike.
		</p>
		<p>
				One of the earliest sections of Virginia-Highland developed in this manner was the Atkins Park District. Conceived in 1908 by Edwin Wiley Grove, Atkins Park was a planned residential community located in the northeastern quadrant of the intersection formed by Highland and Ponce de Leon Avenues. By 1910, Grove had drawn up plans for the suburb and the area was incorporated into Atlanta in 1912. St. Charles, St. Augustine, and St. Louis Avenues were completed by 1918, giving the neighborhood the orderly, intimate scale still prevalent today.
