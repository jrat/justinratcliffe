        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>This visualization was created by myself and Jesse Cook in the Visual Analytics course at SIUE. The goals were to find a dataset and create a visualization that would lead to the discovery of interesting findings.</p>
        <p>The constraints of the assignment were to use Processing and utilize visualization techniques covered throughout the course.</p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <h3>Finding Data and Inspiration</h3>
        <p>The dataset we chose was compiled by Ruut Veenhoven at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. This set had been collected for 20 years and contains data on measured happiness in 14 nations with over 10 comparable datapoints. These datapoints include information such as average happiness, inequality of happiness, and life expectancy. This data has been used in many different contexts attempts to identify trends of happiness in nations and explain the changes of happiness over time.</p>
        <p>We proposed a visualization of a subset of this set that would provide animated visualization over time as well as filtering options. We wanted to users to be able to identify interesting trends over time while also Ô¨Ånding the interface enjoyable. Our inspiration had come from a <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">Ted Talk</a> on Gapminder by Hans Rosling.</p>
        <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
        <p>The application reads from a CSV file containing information on average happiness ratings for 10 countries along with their Gross Domestic Product per capita and average life expectancy.</p>
        <p>Users can play, pause, reset as well as filter which information is most visible by clicking the circles in the legend or on the graph. The name of the country is displayed when the datapoint is hovered over and the time is mapped by a status bar at the bottom.</p>
